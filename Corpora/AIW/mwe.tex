alice was beginning to get very tired of \textbf{sitting $_{1}$} \textbf{by $_{1
}$} her sister on the bank and of having nothing \textbf{to $_{2}$} \textbf{do $_{2
}$} : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , `` and what is the use of a book , '' thought alice , `` without pictures or conversations ? ' \\\\so she was considering , in her own mind ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) , whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of \textbf{getting $_{1}$} \textbf{up $_{1
}$} and picking the daisies , when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her . \\\\there was nothing so very remarkable in that ; nor did alice think it \textbf{so $_{1}$} \textbf{very $_{1
}$} much \textbf{out $_{2}$} \textbf{of $_{2
}$} the way to hear the rabbit say to itself `` oh dear ! oh dear ! i shall be too late ! '' ( when she thought it over afterwards it \textbf{occurred $_{3}$} \textbf{to $_{3
}$} her that she ought to have wondered at this , but at the time it all seemed quite natural ) ; but , when the rabbit actually took a \textbf{watch $_{4}$} \textbf{out $_{4
}$} of its waistcoat-pocket , and \textbf{looked $_{5}$} \textbf{at $_{5
}$} it , and then hurried on , alice started to her feet \textbf{, $_{14}$} \textbf{for $_{6}$} \textbf{it $_{6
}$} flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket , or a watch to \textbf{take $_{7,8}$} \textbf{out $_{7,8
}$} \textbf{of $_{8
}$} it , and burning with curiosity , she ran across the field after it , and was \textbf{just $_{10,11,12}$} \textbf{in $_{9,10,11,12
}$} \textbf{time $_{9,10,11,12
}$} \textbf{to $_{11,12
}$} \textbf{see $_{12
}$} it \textbf{pop $_{13}$} \textbf{down $_{13
}$} a large rabbit-hole under the hedge . \\\\in another moment down went alice after it , never once considering how \textbf{in $_{1}$} \textbf{the $_{1
}$} \textbf{world $_{1
}$} she was to \textbf{get $_{2}$} \textbf{out $_{2
}$} again . \\\\the rabbit-hole \textbf{went $_{1}$} \textbf{straight $_{1
}$} on like a tunnel for some way , and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well . \\\\either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she \textbf{went $_{1}$} \textbf{down $_{1
}$} to \textbf{look $_{2}$} \textbf{about $_{2
}$} her , and to wonder what was \textbf{going $_{3}$} \textbf{to $_{3
}$} happen next . \\\\first , she tried to \textbf{look $_{1}$} \textbf{down $_{1
}$} and \textbf{make $_{2}$} \textbf{out $_{2
}$} what she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything : then she \textbf{looked $_{3}$} \textbf{at $_{3
}$} the sides of the well , and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves : \textbf{here $_{4}$} \textbf{and $_{4
}$} \textbf{there $_{4
}$} she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs . \\\\she \textbf{took $_{1}$} \textbf{down $_{1
}$} ajar from one of the shelves as she passed : it was labeled `` orange marmalade '' but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar , for fear of killing somebody underneath , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it . \\\\\textbf{`` $_{3}$} well ! '' thought alice to herself `` after \textbf{such $_{1}$} \textbf{a $_{1
}$} fall as this , i shall think nothing of tumbling down-stairs ! how brave they 'll all think me \textbf{at $_{2}$} \textbf{home $_{2
}$} ! why , i would n't say anything about it , even if i fell off the top of the house ! '' ( which was very likely true . ) \\\\down \textbf{, $_{1}$} down \textbf{, $_{1
}$} down \textbf{. $_{1
}$} \\\\would the fall never come to an end ? `` i wonder how many miles i 've fallen by this time ? '' she said aloud . \\\\`` i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth . \\\\let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , i think- '' ( for , you see , alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the school-room , and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to say it over ) `` -- yes that 's about the right distance -- but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i 've got to ? '' ( alice had not the slightest idea what latitude was , or longitude either , but she thought they were nice grand words to say . ) \\\\presently she began again . \\\\`` i wonder if i shall fall fight through the earth ! how funny it 'll seem to \textbf{come $_{1}$} \textbf{out $_{1
}$} among the people that walk with their heads downwards ! the antipathies , i think- '' ( she was rather glad there was no one listening , this time , as it did n't sound \textbf{at $_{2}$} \textbf{all $_{2
}$} the right word ) `` -but i shall \textbf{have $_{3}$} \textbf{to $_{3
}$} ask them what the name of the country is , you know . \\\\please , ma'am , is this new zealand ? or australia ? '' ( and she tried to curtsey as she spoke- fancy , curtseying as you 're \textbf{falling $_{1}$} \textbf{through $_{1
}$} the air ! do you think you could manage it ? ) `` and what an ignorant little girl she 'll think me for asking ! no , it 'll never do to ask : perhaps i shall see it \textbf{written $_{2}$} \textbf{up $_{2
}$} somewhere . '' \\\\down \textbf{, $_{1}$} down \textbf{, $_{1
}$} down \textbf{. $_{1
}$} \\\\there was nothing else \textbf{to $_{1}$} \textbf{do $_{1
}$} , so alice soon began talking again . \\\\`` dinah 'll miss me very much to-night , i should think ! '' ( dinah was the cat . ) \\\\`` i hope they 'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time . \\\\dinah , my dear ! i wish you were down here with me ! there are no mice in the air , i 'm afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that 's very like a mouse , you know . \\\\but do cats eat bats , i wonder ? '' and here alice began to get rather sleepy , and \textbf{went $_{1}$} \textbf{on $_{1
}$} saying to herself , in a dreamy son of way , `` do cats eat bats ? do cats eat bats ? '' and sometimes `` do bats eat cats ? '' for , you see , as she could n't answer either question , it did n't much matter which way she put it . \\\\she felt that she was dozing off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand \textbf{in $_{1}$} \textbf{hand $_{1
}$} with dinah , and was saying to her , very earnestly , `` now , dinah , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ? '' when suddenly , thump ! thump \textbf{! $_{3}$} down she \textbf{came $_{2}$} \textbf{upon $_{2
}$} a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over . \\\\alice was not a bit hurt , and she \textbf{jumped $_{1}$} \textbf{up $_{1
}$} on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead : before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still \textbf{in $_{2}$} \textbf{sight $_{2
}$} , \textbf{hurrying $_{3}$} \textbf{down $_{3
}$} it . \\\\there was not a moment to be lost \textbf{: $_{1}$} \textbf{away $_{1
}$} went alice like the wind , and was \textbf{just $_{3}$} \textbf{in $_{2,3
}$} \textbf{time $_{2,3
}$} to hear it say , as it turned a comer , `` oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! '' she was close behind it when she turned the comer , but the rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was \textbf{lit $_{4}$} \textbf{up $_{4
}$} by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . \\\\there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when alice had been \textbf{all $_{1}$} \textbf{the $_{1
}$} way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to \textbf{get $_{2}$} \textbf{out $_{2
}$} again . \\\\suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table , all \textbf{made $_{1}$} \textbf{of $_{1
}$} solid glass : there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key , and alice 's first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them . \\\\however , on the second time round , she \textbf{came $_{1}$} \textbf{upon $_{1
}$} a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted ! \\\\alice opened the door and found that it \textbf{led $_{1}$} \textbf{into $_{1
}$} a small passage , \textbf{not $_{2}$} \textbf{much $_{2
}$} larger than a rat-hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . \\\\how she longed to \textbf{get $_{1}$} \textbf{out $_{1
}$} of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; `` and even if my head would \textbf{go $_{2}$} \textbf{through $_{2
}$} , '' thought poor alice , `` it would be of very little use without my shoulders . \\\\oh , how i wish i could \textbf{shut $_{1}$} \textbf{up $_{1
}$} like a telescope ! i think i could , if i only knew how to begin . '' \\\\for , you see , so many out-of-the- way things had happened lately , that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible . \\\\there seemed to be \textbf{no $_{1}$} \textbf{use $_{1
}$} in \textbf{waiting $_{2}$} \textbf{by $_{2
}$} the little door , so she \textbf{went $_{3,4}$} \textbf{back $_{3,4
}$} \textbf{to $_{4
}$} the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , ( `` which certainly was not here before , '' said alice ) , and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words `` drink me '' beautifully \textbf{printed $_{5}$} \textbf{on $_{5
}$} it in large letters . \\\\it was all \textbf{very $_{1}$} \textbf{well $_{1
}$} to say `` drink me , '' but the wise little alice was not \textbf{going $_{2}$} \textbf{to $_{2
}$} do that \textbf{in $_{3}$} \textbf{a $_{3
}$} \textbf{hurry $_{3
}$} . \\\\`` no , i 'll look first , '' she said , `` and see whether it 's marked 'poison ' or not '' ; for she had read several nice little stories about children who had got burnt , and \textbf{eaten $_{1}$} \textbf{up $_{1
}$} by wild beasts , and other unpleasant things , all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that , if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked `` poison , '' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later . \\\\however , this bottle was not marked `` poison , '' so alice ventured to taste it , and , finding it very nice ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart , custard , pine-apple , roast turkey , toffy , and hot buttered toast ) , she very soon finished it off . \\\\`` what a curious feeling ! '' said alice . \\\\`` i must be shutting up like a telescope ! '' \\\\`` what a curious feeling ! '' said alice . \\\\`` i must be shutting up like a telescope ! '' \\\\and so it was indeed : she was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for \textbf{going $_{1}$} \textbf{through $_{1
}$} the little door into that lovely garden . \\\\first , however , she \textbf{waited $_{1}$} \textbf{for $_{1
}$} a few minutes to see if she was \textbf{going $_{2}$} \textbf{to $_{2
}$} shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this ; \textbf{`` $_{6}$} \textbf{for $_{3}$} \textbf{it $_{3
}$} might end , \textbf{you $_{4}$} \textbf{know $_{4
}$} , '' said alice to herself ; `` in my \textbf{going $_{5}$} \textbf{out $_{5
}$} altogether , like a candle . \\\\i wonder what i should be like then ? '' and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is \textbf{blown $_{1}$} \textbf{out $_{1
}$} , for she could not remember ever having seen \textbf{such $_{2}$} \textbf{a $_{2
}$} thing . \\\\after a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on \textbf{going $_{1}$} \textbf{into $_{1
}$} the garden at once ; but , alas for poor alice ! when she \textbf{got $_{2}$} \textbf{to $_{2
}$} the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she \textbf{went $_{3,4}$} \textbf{back $_{3,4
}$} \textbf{to $_{4
}$} the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to \textbf{climb $_{5}$} \textbf{up $_{5
}$} one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing \textbf{sat $_{6}$} \textbf{down $_{6
}$} and cried . \\\\`` come , there 's \textbf{no $_{1}$} \textbf{use $_{1
}$} in crying like that ! '' said alice to herself rather sharply . \\\\`` i advise you to \textbf{leave $_{1}$} \textbf{off $_{1
}$} this minute ! '' she generally gave herself very good advice ( though she very seldom followed it ) , and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes ; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was \textbf{playing $_{2}$} \textbf{against $_{2
}$} herself , for this curious child was very \textbf{fond $_{3}$} \textbf{of $_{3
}$} pretending to be two people . \\\\\textbf{`` $_{5}$} but it 's \textbf{no $_{1}$} \textbf{use $_{1
}$} now , '' thought poor alice , \textbf{`` $_{2}$} \textbf{to $_{2
}$} \textbf{pretend $_{3}$} \textbf{to $_{3
}$} be two people ! why , there 's hardly enough of me \textbf{left $_{4}$} \textbf{to $_{4
}$} make one respectable person ! '' \\\\soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which the words `` eat me '' were beautifully marked in currants . \\\\\textbf{`` $_{2}$} well , i 'll eat it , '' said alice , `` and if it makes me grow larger , i can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , i can creep under the door : so either way i 'll \textbf{get $_{1}$} \textbf{into $_{1
}$} the garden , and i do n't care which happens ! '' \\\\she ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself `` which way ? which way ? `` , holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing ; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size . \\\\to \textbf{be $_{1}$} \textbf{sure $_{1
}$} , this is what generally happens when one eats cake ; but alice had got \textbf{so $_{2}$} \textbf{much $_{2
}$} into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen , that it seemed quite dull and stupid \textbf{for $_{3}$} \textbf{life $_{3
}$} to \textbf{go $_{4}$} \textbf{on $_{4
}$} in the common way . \\\\so she set to work , and very soon finished off the cake . \\\\
